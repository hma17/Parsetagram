## Notes

The biggest challenge was understanding the general movements between the fragments, activities, and adapters. While I worked on the app, this became easier to understand, however I always needed a constant reminder on how to do that buy looking at my previous movements. Towards the end, I was trying to get the data for the user to show up on the profile, but I ran out of time. I will work on this because I think it is important for all app devolpment!
